## Angular Test
This is my attempt at learning the basics of Angular. It has basic examples of how to use some of the fundamentals of angular.

### Branches
There are 3 branches currently in the project. If you want to see certain features I have put them under a branch.
   - [Controllers](https://github.com/rizowski/Angular-Test/tree/Controllers)
   - [Modules](https://github.com/rizowski/Angular-Test/tree/Modules)
   - [Directives](https://github.com/rizowski/Angular-Test/tree/Directives)

Nothing special is need for running any of these branches as they only have angular for testing it out.

Enjoy!
